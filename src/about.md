## Works & Projects

* **Klefki**,  Klefki is a playground for researching elliptic curve group based cryptocoins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. All data types & structures are based on mathematical defination of abstract algebra.

* **ExchangeableToken**,  A extension for Ethereum based tokens, which added an build-in exchange. 

* **AlphaTown**, A 2D Virtual Social Network</br>
	www.alphatown.com

* **hogwarts**, A Learning Router, for researchers, implementated with *Clojure*.
	
* **CardKit**,  A mobile UI framework to help you build mobile web apps quickly and simply, or transfer entire website to native-like web app for touch devices

* **Stack / Stack-cli**, A missing The Tool stack for Python

* **pWsgi**, pWSGI is a WSGI wrapper with pulsar. It can easily map a wsgi app (such as Flask app or djang app) to a pulsar wsgi app with full features supporting by pulsar.

* **rc4-python3**, rc4 implementation via py3.

* **fn-compose**,  Make python support function compostion with matrix_mul operator 

* **shadowsocks4blackberry**, Ported shadowsocks-libev to blackberry QNX OS.
